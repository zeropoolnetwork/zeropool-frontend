        We use Kovan test network to emulate operations with Ethereum and standard Near's test
        network for the Near. Operations with Waves are not yet implemented.
      </p>

      <h3>Ethereum</h3>

      <p>
        To try it out you can install Metamask, select Kovan network, get some free Eth from the
        <a href="https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          {' '}kovan faucet{' '}
        </a>
        and send it to one of your Zero Pool <b>Eth</b> Wallet's address.
      </p>

      <h3>Near</h3>

      <p>
        You can register
        <a href="https://wallet.testnet.near.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          {' '}
          Near test wallet{' '}
        </a>
        and send tokens recieved upon registration to one of your Zero Pool <b>Near</b> Wallet's
        address and back.
      </p>
